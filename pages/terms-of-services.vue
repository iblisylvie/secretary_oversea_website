        utilizing our name or trademarks without our express written consent.
        Additionally, you agree that you will not: (i) take any action that
        imposes, or may impose in our sole discretion an unreasonable or
        disproportionately large load on our infrastructure; (ii) interfere or
        attempt to interfere with the proper working of the App or any
        activities conducted as part of the App; or (iii) bypass any measures we

        to you.
      </li>
      <li>
        Copyright and Ownership. All of the content featured or displayed on the
        App, including without limitation text, graphics, photographs, images,
        moving images, sound, and illustrations ("Content"), is owned by
        HeyTico, its licensors, vendors, agents and/or its Content providers.
        All elements of the App, including without limitation the general design
        and the Content, are protected by trade dress, copyright, moral rights,
        trademark and other laws relating to intellectual property rights. The
        App may only be used for the intended purpose for which such App is
        being made available. Except as permitted by copyright law, You may not
        modify any of the materials and you may not copy, distribute, transmit,
        display, perform, reproduce, publish, license, create derivative works
        from, transfer or sell any information or work contained on the App.
        Except as authorized under the copyright laws, you are responsible for
        obtaining permission before reusing any copyrighted material that is
        available on the App. You shall comply with all applicable domestic and
        international laws, statutes, ordinances and regulations regarding your
        use of the App. The App, its Content and all related rights shall remain
        the exclusive property of HeyTico or its licensors unless otherwise
        expressly agreed. You will not remove any copyright, trademark or other
        proprietary notices from material found on the App.
      </li>
      <li>
        Trademarks/No Endorsement. All trademarks, service marks and trade names
        of HeyTico used herein (including but not limited to: HeyTico name,
        HeyTico corporate logo, the App name, the App design, and any logos)
        (collectively "Marks") are trademarks or registered trademarks of

        modify HeyTico trademarks in any way, including in advertising or
        publicity pertaining to distribution of materials on the App, without
        HeyTico's prior written consent. You shall not use HeyTico’s name or any
        language, pictures or symbols which could, in HeyTico’s judgment, imply
        HeyTico’s endorsement in any (i) written or oral advertising or
        presentation, or (ii) brochure, newsletter, book, or other written
        material of whatever nature, without prior written consent.
      </li>
      <li>
        Account Registration and Security. You understand that you may need to
        create an account to have access to all of the parts of the App. In
        order to use those restricted portions of the App, you will: (a) provide
        true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself and your
        business as prompted by the App's registration or subscription page
        (such information being the "Registration Data") and (b) maintain and
        promptly update the Registration Data to keep it true, accurate, current
        and complete. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate,
        not current or incomplete, or HeyTico has reasonable grounds to suspect
        that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete,
        HeyTico has the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse
        any and all current or future use of the App (or any portion thereof).
        You are entirely responsible for the security and confidentiality of
        your password and account. Furthermore, you are entirely responsible for
        any and all activities that occur under your account. You will not share
        your account information or your user name and password with any third
        party or permit any third party to logon to the App using your account
        information. You agree to immediately notify us of any unauthorized use
        of your account or any other breach of security of which you become
        aware. You are responsible for taking precautions and providing security
        measures best suited for your situation and intended use of the App. We
        have the right to provide user billing, account, Content or use records,
        and related information under certain circumstances (such as in response
        to legal responsibility, lawful process, orders, subpoenas, or warrants,
        or to protect our rights, customers or business). Please note that
        anyone able to provide your personally identifiable information will be
        able to access your account so you should take reasonable steps to
        protect this information.
      </li>
      <li>
        Solicited Submission Policy. Where HeyTico has specifically invited or
        requested submissions or comments, HeyTico encourages users to submit
        content (e.g. comments to blog posts, participation in communities,
        tips, etc.) to HeyTico that they have created for consideration in
        connection with the App ("User Submissions"). User Submissions remains
        the intellectual property of the individual user. By posting content on
        the App, you expressly grant HeyTico a non-exclusive, perpetual,
        irrevocable, royalty-free, fully paid-up worldwide, fully sub-licensable
        right to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create
        derivative works from, distribute, transmit, perform and display such
        content and your name, voice, and/or likeness as contained in your User
        Submission, in whole or in part, and in any form throughout the world in
        any media or technology, whether now known or hereafter discovered,
        including all promotion, advertising, marketing, merchandising,
        publicity and any other ancillary uses thereof, and including the
        unfettered right to sublicense such rights, in perpetuity throughout the
        universe. Any such User Submissions are deemed non-confidential and
        HeyTico shall be under no obligation to maintain the confidentiality of
        any information, in whatever form, contained in any User Submission.
      </li>
      <li>
        Inappropriate User Submissions. HeyTico does not encourage, and does not
        seek User Submissions that result from any activity that: (i) may create
        a risk of harm, loss, physical or mental injury, emotional distress,
        death, disability, disfigurement, or physical or mental illness to you,
        to any other person, or to any animal; (ii) may create a risk of any
        other loss or damage to any person or property; or (iii) may constitute
        a crime or tort. You agree that you have not and will not engage in any
        of the foregoing activities in connection with producing your
        submission. Without limiting the foregoing, you agree that in
        conjunction with your submission, you will not inflict emotional
        distress on other people, will not humiliate other people (publicly or
        otherwise), will not assault or threaten other people, will not enter
        onto private property without permission, will not impersonate any other
        person or misrepresent your affiliation, title, or authority, and will
        not otherwise engage in any activity that may result in injury, death,
        property damage, and/or liability of any kind. HeyTico will reject any
        submissions in which HeyTico believes, in its sole discretion, that any
        such activities have occurred. If notified by a user of a submission
        that allegedly violates any provision of these Terms of Use, HeyTico
        reserves the right to determine, in its sole discretion, if such a
        violation has occurred, and to remove any such submission from the App
        at any time and without notice.
      </li>
      <li>
        Inappropriate Material. You are prohibited from using the App or the
        Services to post or send any unlawful, infringing, threatening,
        defamatory, libelous, obscene, pornographic or profane material or any
        material that infringes or misappropriates third party intellectual
        property or could constitute or encourage conduct that would be
        considered a criminal offense or give rise to civil liability, or
        otherwise violate any law. You further understand and agree that sending
        unsolicited advertisements or "spam" to any user of the Services is
        expressly prohibited by this Agreement. In addition to any remedies that
        we may have at law or in equity, if we determine, in our sole
        discretion, that you have violated or are likely to violate the
        foregoing prohibitions or any applicable rules or policies linked to in
        this Agreement, we may take any action we deem necessary to cure or
        prevent the violation, including without limitation, banning you from
        participating in our Services and/or the immediate removal of the
        related materials from the Services at any time without notice. We will
        fully cooperate with any law enforcement authorities or court order or
        subpoena requesting or directing us to disclose the identity of anyone
        posting such materials.
      </li>
      <li>
        User Published Content. User published Content and User Submissions do
        not represent the views of HeyTico or any individual associated with
        HeyTico, and we do not control this Content. In no event shall you
        represent or suggest, directly or indirectly, HeyTico’s endorsement of
        user published Content. HeyTico does not vouch for the accuracy or
        credibility of any user published Content on our App or User Submissions
        published through our Services, and do not take any responsibility or
        assume any liability for any actions you may take as a result of
        reviewing any such user published Content or User Submission. Through
        your use of the App and Services, you may be exposed to Content that you
        may find offensive, objectionable, harmful, inaccurate or deceptive.
        There may also be risks of dealing with underage persons, people acting
        under false pretense, international trade issues and foreign nationals.
        By using our App and Services, you assume all associated risks.
      </li>
      <li>
        Contests, Sweepstakes and Games. From time to time HeyTico may offer
        contests, sweepstakes and games. Additional terms and conditions will
        apply to your participation in each contest, sweepstakes or game.
      </li>
      <li>
        Advertising Rights. HeyTico reserves the right to sell, license and/or
        display any advertising, attribution, links, promotional and/or
        distribution rights in connection with your creative submission, and
        HeyTico and its licensors or affiliates will be entitled to retain any
        and all revenue generated from any sales or licenses of such
        advertising, attribution, links, or promotional or distribution rights.
        Nothing in these additional terms obligates or may be deemed to obligate
        HeyTico to sell, license or offer to sell or license any advertising,
        promotion or distribution rights.
      </li>
      <li>
        Third Party Links. From time to time, the App may contain links to web
        sites that are not owned, operated or controlled by HeyTico or its
        affiliates. All such links are provided solely as a convenience to you.
        If you use these links, you will leave the App. Neither we nor any of
        our respective affiliates are responsible for any content, materials or
        other information located on or accessible from any other web site.
        Neither we nor any of our respective affiliates endorse, guarantee, or
        make any representations or warranties regarding any other web sites, or
        any content, materials or other information located or accessible from
        any other web sites, or the results that you may obtain from using any
        other web sites. If you decide to access any other web sites linked to
        or from the App, you do so entirely at your own risk.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transactional Partners. In some cases we partner with another company to
        co-promote their services within our App. In these cases, you are
        transacting directly with the other party. On those pages, the
        transactional partners’ brand is clearly visible. When using these
        partner’s services, you are bound by such partner’s terms of service. We
        recommend you read their terms of service carefully.
      </li>
      <li>
        Accuracy of Information. We attempt to ensure that information on the
        App is complete, accurate and current. Despite our efforts, the
        information on the App may occasionally be inaccurate, incomplete or out
        of date. We make no representation as to the completeness, accuracy or
        currency of any information on the App. For example, products included
        on the App may be unavailable, may have different attributes than those
        listed, or may actually carry a different price than that stated on the
        App. In addition, we may make changes in information about price and
        availability without notice. While it is our practice to confirm orders
        by email, the receipt of an email order confirmation does not constitute
        our acceptance of an order or our confirmation of an offer to sell a
        product or service. We reserve the right, without prior notice, to limit
        the order quantity on any product or service and/or to refuse service to
        any customer. We also may require verification of information prior to
        the acceptance and/or shipment of any order.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fees. For all charges or deposits for any events, products and services
        sold on or through the App, HeyTico or its vendors or agents will bill
        your bank card or alternative payment method offered by HeyTico. When
        you provide bank card information, account numbers or other information
        necessary to facilitate payment to us or our vendors, you represent to
        us that you are the authorized user of the bank card or account of
        alternative payment method that is used to pay for the products and
        services. In the event legal action is necessary to collect on balances
        due, you agree to reimburse HeyTico and its vendors or agents for all
        expenses incurred to recover sums due, including attorneys’ fees and
        other legal expenses. You are responsible for purchase of, and payment
        of charges for, all Internet access services and telecommunications
        services needed for use of the App. You understand that we will hold and
        store such bank card or payment information to facilitate payment and
        deposit, damage reimbursement, and other liability purposes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Eligibility to Subscribe to Services. You may subscribe to the Services
        offered on the App in any location worldwide. HeyTico makes no promise,
        however, that the Services available on the App are appropriate or
        available for use in locations outside the territory designated by
        HeyTico for the App, and accessing the App from territories where its
        contents are illegal or unlawful is prohibited. If You choose to access
        the App from locations outside the designated territory, You do so at
        your own risk. It is your responsibility to ascertain and obey all
        applicable local and international laws (including minimum age
        requirements) in regard to Services you subscribe to through the App.
      </li>
      <li>
        Right to Takedown Content. Except as disclosed in our Privacy Policy, we
        will not monitor, edit, or disclose the contents of a user's e-mail
        unless required in the course of normal maintenance of the App and its
        systems or unless required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief
        that such action is necessary to: (1) comply with the law or comply with
        legal process served on HeyTico or the App; (2) protect and defend the
        rights or property of HeyTico, the App, or the users of the App; or (3)
        act in an emergency to protect the personal safety of our guests, the
        App, or the public. Users shall remain solely responsible for the
        content of their messages and HeyTico shall have no obligation to
        prescreen any such content. However, we shall have the right in our sole
        discretion to edit, refuse to post or remove any material submitted to
        or posted on the App at any time without notice. Without limiting the
        foregoing, we shall have the right to remove any material that we find
        to be in violation of the provisions hereof or otherwise objectionable,
        and the additional right to deny any user who fails to conform to any
        provision of these Terms of Service access to the App.
      </li>
      <li>
        Termination. You or we may suspend or terminate your account or your use
        of the App at any time, for any reason or for no reason. You are
        personally liable for any orders placed or charges incurred through your
        account prior to termination. We may also block your access to our App
        in the event that (a) you breach these Terms of Service; (b) we are
        unable to verify or authenticate any information you provide to us; or
        (c) we believe that your actions may cause financial loss or legal
        liability for you, our users or us.
      </li>
      <li>

        A printed version of these Terms of Service will be admissible in
        judicial and administrative proceedings based upon or relating to these
        Terms of Service to the same extent and subject to the same conditions
        as other business documents and records originally generated and
        maintained in printed form. We do not guarantee continuous,

        purposes only and in no way define, limit, construe or describe the
        scope or extent of such section. Our failure to act with respect to a
        breach by you or others does not waive our right to act with respect to
        subsequent or similar breaches. These Terms of Service set forth the
        entire understanding and agreement between us with respect to the
        subject matter hereof. All sections which by their context ought to
        survive this Agreement shall survive any termination or expiration of
